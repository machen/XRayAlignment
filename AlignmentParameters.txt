Alignment Parameters

Assume that As Filled is the "base" coordinate system

Coordinates are in mm

Device 6G

Region 1

Alignment Point: High point on large post

AsFilled: [-0.205, 4.045]
AGWRinse: [-0.18, 4.04], Displacement: [+0.025,-0.005]
SFlush: [-0.165, 4.035], Displacement: [+0.040, -0.01]

AsFilled is larger, which is causing some issues

Region 2

Alignment point: Top point of the complete post, darker part of bright region

AsFilled: [0.705, 1.325]
AGWRinse: [0.735, 1.315], Displacement: [0.03, -0.01]
SFlush: [0.75, 1.315], Displacement: [0.045, -0.015]

Region 3

Alignment Point: Point at 4 o' clock (4 pixels), top right pixel

AsFilled: [-2.46, -0.52]
AGWRinse: [-2.43, -0.525], Displacement: [0.03, -0.005]
SFlush: [-2.415, -0.53], Displacement: [0.045, -0.01]

Region 4

Alignment point: Far right bright spot in the As map

As Filled: [2.94, 1.21]
AGW Rinse: [2.97, 1.205]
SFlush: [2.98, 1.2]

Region 5

Alignment point: Bottom bright spot, Fe map

AsFilled: [-1.91, 3.55]
AGW Rinse: [-1.885, 3.545], displacement: [0.025, -0.01]
SFlush: [-1.87, 3.54], displacement: [0.04, -0.015]
