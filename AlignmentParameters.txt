Alignment Parameters

Assume that As Filled is the "base" coordinate system

Coordinates are in mm

Device 6G

Region 1

Alignment Point: High point on large post

AsFilled: [-0.205, 4.045]
AGWRinse: [-0.18, 4.04], Displacement: [+0.025,-0.005]
SFlush: [-0.165, 4.035], Displacement: [+0.040, -0.01]

AsFilled has two extra rows, potentially duplicates

Region 2

Alignment point: Top point of the complete post, darker part of bright region

AsFilled: [0.705, 1.325]
AGWRinse: [0.735, 1.315], Displacement: [0.03, -0.01]
SFlush: [0.75, 1.315], Displacement: [0.045, -0.01]

Region 3

Alignment point: Lower Right brightspot (lower level, middle pixel)

AsFilled: [-2.43,-0.575]
AGWRinse: [-2.4, -0.58], Displacement: [0.03, -0.005]
SFlush: [-2.385, -0.585], Displacement: [0.045, -0.01]
